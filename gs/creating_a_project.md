# Creating A Project

To begin, open a terminal and run the command:

```bash
$ tmplytr use Lauriethefish/quest-mod-template
```

## Restoring Dependencies

Before you can open your project in an IDE, you must first restore all dependencies.

Open your terminal into your newly created project and run:

```bash
qpm-rust restore
qpm-rust cache legacy-fix
```
